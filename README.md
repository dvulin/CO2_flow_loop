# Flow Loop System for CO<sub>2</sub> Corrosion Measurement

This repository contains code and supporting files for simulating a **flow loop system** used to measure corrosion under conditions relevant to CO<sub>2</sub> transport via pipelines. The goal of this project is to mitigate risks associated with CO<sub>2</sub> transport by ensuring pipelines operate under safe flow and pressure conditions.

## Overview

Pipelines carrying CO<sub>2</sub> in liquid or supercritical states can be subject to corrosion, which poses operational and safety risks. This code models the pressure drop, flow rate, and physical properties (density, viscosity, etc.) of CO<sub>2</sub> (or a CO<sub>2</sub>-containing mixture) along a pipeline segment. By iterating over various pipeline diameters, pressures, temperatures, and surface roughness values, this program helps engineers evaluate feasible operating windows and identify potential risks.

---

## Key Features

- **Pressure Drop Calculation**: Computes the pressure gradient along the pipeline based on mass flow, fluid properties, and friction factors.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Allows you to easily change inputs such as diameter, roughness, or flow conditions to see how they affect the final pressure.  
- **Data Lookup**: Uses an external lookup table (via CSV) for CO<sub>2</sub> properties (liquid fraction, density, viscosity, etc.) across various pressures and temperatures.  
- **Structured Output**: Generates data files (`.csv` and `.json`) summarizing key simulation results, including final outlet pressures under different conditions.

## Project Structure

A possible structure for your repository might be:

```

├── results/
│   └── ...                    # Directory to store output CSV/JSON files
└── ...
```

- **`flow_functions.py`**: Helper functions for fluid flow, friction factor calculations, etc.  
- **`other_functions.py`**: Utility functions (e.g., reading/writing data, unit conversions).  
- **`main.py`**: Main entry point script that runs the full simulation.  
- **`data/`**: Directory containing lookup tables or any relevant data for the simulation.  
- **`results/`**: Where the script stores output files (pressure drop summaries, JSON logs, etc.).  

Feel free to rename or restructure according to your preferences.

## Dependencies

This project relies on Python 3.x and the following libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` for easy installation):
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Warnings (standard library)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html)
- [Datetime (standard library)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- Additional internal modules/files (e.g., `flow_functions.py`, `other_functions.py`)

To install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/FlowLoopCO2Corrosion.git
   cd FlowLoopCO2Corrosion
   ```
2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Check the data**: Ensure your CSV lookup table(s) are in the correct directory (e.g., `data/lookup_table_case1.csv`).

---

## Usage

1. **Configure parameters**: In the `main.py` file, you can modify the following key parameters before running the script:
   - `pure_CO2`: Boolean indicating whether you are testing with pure CO<sub>2</sub>.  
   - `case`: Lookup file identifier; determines which CSV file is loaded.  
   - `p1`, `T1`, `L`, `e`, `D`, etc.: Operational parameters such as inlet pressure, temperature, pipeline length, roughness, and diameter.  
   - `qm`: Mass flow rate of CO<sub>2</sub>.  
   - `nsteps`: Number of discretized steps for the simulation along the pipe length.  
   - `boosters`: (Boolean) Toggle for additional pressure boosting stations.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This script:
   - Loads the lookup data.
   - Iterates through multiple pressure and diameter scenarios.
   - Performs a stepwise pressure drop calculation.
   - Saves summary files in CSV and JSON format to directories named by case.

3. **Review outputs**:
   - Look for text files named like `case_summary_nsteps_<value>_t_<value>.txt` for final summary tables of outlet pressure.  
   - JSON files are saved under the same naming convention, containing more detailed step-by-step results.

## Code Explanation

Below is a high-level walkthrough of the main logic (as shown in `main.py`):

1. **Import Modules**: Loads the standard libraries and your custom modules `flow_functions` and `other_functions`.  
2. **Load Lookup Table**: A CSV file specific to the chosen `case` (e.g., `"lookup_table_case1.csv"`) provides fluid properties at different T/P conditions.  
3. **Parameter Setup**: Define the pipeline geometry, CO<sub>2</sub> flow rate, step count, etc.  
4. **Sensitivity Loops**: Multiple nested loops change pipeline diameter, roughness, pressure, temperature, and so on. Each loop calls a routine (`dp_table()`) to calculate pressure drop across each step in the pipeline.  
5. **Data Logging**: For each run, the script compiles results into Pandas DataFrames, which are written to `.csv` files and a `.json` file.  
6. **Runtime Calculation**: A simple measurement of how long each simulation set takes, logged at the end.
